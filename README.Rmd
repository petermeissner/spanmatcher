**Status:** experimental, for own education only, possibly subject to change, still quite slow

**Author:** Peter Mei√üner

**Licence:** GPL-2

**Description:**

Merging time span data used for survival analysis via building new
    spans out of overlapping spans. For each context change (id1 data changes |
    id2 data changes)  a new span is formed. Spans neither covered within
    dataset 1 nor 2 are put into separate spans.

**Installation and start - development version**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("petermeissner/spanmatcher")
library(spanmatcher)
```



<br><br>
**Usage**

Loading the package and making up some data

```{r}
library(spanmatcher)

df1 = data.frame(
  id1 = letters[1:5],
  from2 = as.Date(c(1,3,4,7,8), origin = "1970-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(2,4,5,9,10), origin = "1970-01-01")
)

df2 = data.frame(
  id2   = LETTERS[11:13],
  from2 = as.Date(c(2,7,7), origin = "1970-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(5,9,11), origin = "1970-01-01")
) 

df1

df2
```


Mergin/joining the data

```{r}
span_matcher(df1, df2)
```


Splitting spans

```{r}
span_matcher(df1,df2, split_after = c(4))
span_matcher(df1,df2, split_before = c(10))
```
