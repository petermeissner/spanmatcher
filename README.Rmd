**Status:** working but experimental and possibly subject to change

**Author:** Peter MeiÃŸner

**Licence:** GPL-2

**Description:**

Merging time span data used for survival analysis via building new
    spans out of overlapping spans. For each context change (id1 data changes |
    id2 data changes)  a new span is formed. Spans neither covered within
    dataset 1 nor 2 are put into separate spans.


**Installation and start - development version**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("petermeissner/spanmatcher")
library(spanmatcher)
```

**Usage**

Loading the package and making up some data ... 

```{r}
library(spanmatcher)

df1 = data.frame(
  id1 = paste(letters[1:5], round(runif(5)*10000), sep="_" ),
  from2 = as.Date(c(1,3000,4000,7000,8000), origin = "1960-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(2000,4000,5000,9000,10000), origin = "1960-01-01")
)

df2 = data.frame(
  id2   = paste(LETTERS[11:13], round(runif(3)*10000), sep="_" ),
  from2 = as.Date(c(2,7000,7000), origin = "1960-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(5000,9000,11000), origin = "1960-01-01")
) 
```

... having a look at the data ... 

```{r}
df1

df2
```


Mergin/joining the data.

```{r}
head(span_matcher(df1, df2))
```
