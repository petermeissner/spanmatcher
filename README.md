# spanmatcher

**Status:** working but experimental and possibly subject to change

**Author:** Peter MeiÃŸner

**Licence:** GPL-2

**Description:**

Merging time span data used for survival analysis via building new
    spans out of overlapping spans. For each context change (id1 data changes |
    id2 data changes)  a new span is formed. Spans neither covered within
    dataset 1 nor 2 are put into separate spans.


**Installation and start - development version**


```r
devtools::install_github("petermeissner/spanmatcher")
library(spanmatcher)
```

**Usage**

Loading the package and making up some data ... 


```r
library(spanmatcher)

df1 = data.frame(
  id1 = paste(letters[1:5], round(runif(5)*10000), sep="_" ),
  from2 = as.Date(c(1,3000,4000,7000,8000), origin = "1960-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(2000,4000,5000,9000,10000), origin = "1960-01-01")
)

df2 = data.frame(
  id2   = paste(LETTERS[11:13], round(runif(3)*10000), sep="_" ),
  from2 = as.Date(c(2,7000,7000), origin = "1960-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(5000,9000,11000), origin = "1960-01-01")
) 
```

... having a look at the data ... 


```r
df1
```

```
##      id1      from2        to2
## 1 a_2094 1960-01-02 1965-06-23
## 2 b_5594 1968-03-19 1970-12-14
## 3 c_8344 1970-12-14 1973-09-09
## 4 d_9865 1979-03-02 1984-08-22
## 5 e_9883 1981-11-26 1987-05-19
```

```r
df2
```

```
##      id2      from2        to2
## 1 K_4979 1960-01-03 1973-09-09
## 2 L_3472 1979-03-02 1984-08-22
## 3 M_9195 1979-03-02 1990-02-12
```


Mergin/joining the data.


```r
head(span_matcher(df1, df2))
```

```
##      id1    id2 start   end
## 1 a_2094 K_4979 -3651 -1653
## 2 b_5594 K_4979  -653   347
## 3 c_8344 K_4979   347  1347
## 4 d_9865 L_3472  3347  5347
## 5 e_9883 L_3472  4347  5347
## 6 d_9865 M_9195  3347  5347
