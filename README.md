**Status:** working but experimental and possibly subject to change

**Author:** Peter Mei√üner

**Licence:** GPL-2

**Description:**

Merging time span data used for survival analysis via building new
    spans out of overlapping spans. For each context change (id1 data changes |
    id2 data changes)  a new span is formed. Spans neither covered within
    dataset 1 nor 2 are put into separate spans.

**Installation and start - development version**


```r
devtools::install_github("petermeissner/spanmatcher")
library(spanmatcher)
```



<br><br>
**Usage**

Loading the package and making up some data


```r
library(spanmatcher)

df1 = data.frame(
  id1 = letters[1:5],
  from2 = as.Date(c(1,3,4,7,8), origin = "1970-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(2,4,5,9,10), origin = "1970-01-01")
)

df2 = data.frame(
  id2   = LETTERS[11:13],
  from2 = as.Date(c(2,7,7), origin = "1970-01-01"),
  to2   = as.Date(c(5,9,11), origin = "1970-01-01")
) 

df1
```

```
##   id1      from2        to2
## 1   a 1970-01-02 1970-01-03
## 2   b 1970-01-04 1970-01-05
## 3   c 1970-01-05 1970-01-06
## 4   d 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 5   e 1970-01-09 1970-01-11
```

```r
df2
```

```
##   id2      from2        to2
## 1   K 1970-01-03 1970-01-06
## 2   L 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 3   M 1970-01-08 1970-01-12
```


Mergin/joining the data


```r
span_matcher(df1, df2)
```

```
##     id1  id2      start        end
## 1     a <NA> 1970-01-02 1970-01-02
## 2     a    K 1970-01-03 1970-01-03
## 3     b    K 1970-01-04 1970-01-05
## 4     c    K 1970-01-05 1970-01-06
## 5  <NA> <NA> 1970-01-07 1970-01-07
## 6     d    L 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 7     d    M 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 8     e    L 1970-01-09 1970-01-10
## 9     e    M 1970-01-09 1970-01-11
## 10 <NA>    M 1970-01-12 1970-01-12
```


Splitting spans


```r
span_matcher(df1,df2, split_after = c(4))
```

```
##     id1  id2      start        end
## 1     a <NA> 1970-01-02 1970-01-02
## 2     a    K 1970-01-03 1970-01-03
## 3     b    K 1970-01-04 1970-01-05
## 4     c    K 1970-01-05 1970-01-05
## 5     c    K 1970-01-06 1970-01-06
## 6  <NA> <NA> 1970-01-07 1970-01-07
## 7     d    L 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 8     d    M 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 9     e    L 1970-01-09 1970-01-10
## 10    e    M 1970-01-09 1970-01-11
## 11 <NA>    M 1970-01-12 1970-01-12
```

```r
span_matcher(df1,df2, split_before = c(10))
```

```
##     id1  id2      start        end
## 1     a <NA> 1970-01-02 1970-01-02
## 2     a    K 1970-01-03 1970-01-03
## 3     b    K 1970-01-04 1970-01-05
## 4     c    K 1970-01-05 1970-01-06
## 5  <NA> <NA> 1970-01-07 1970-01-07
## 6     d    L 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 7     d    M 1970-01-08 1970-01-10
## 8     e    L 1970-01-09 1970-01-10
## 9     e    M 1970-01-09 1970-01-10
## 10    e    M 1970-01-11 1970-01-11
## 11 <NA>    M 1970-01-12 1970-01-12
